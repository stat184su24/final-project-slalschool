This is an outline for your final project. You can follow this outline, or you can modify it as you see fit. Do what works best for your project. 

## Research Question 

State your general specific question and why it is interesting. 

How do different product categories affect sales performance in large retail stores (Walmart and Big Mart)?



## Data Processing 

#### Data Intake 

# R code and a written explanation to import your **TWO** data sets.
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

retail_sales_dataset <- read.csv("retail_sales_dataset.csv")
walmart_sales_data <- read.csv("Walmart_Sales_Data.csv")
head(retail_sales_dataset)
head(walmart_sales_data)
#summary(retail_sales_dataset)
#summary(walmart_data)


#### Data Wrangling 

Include R code and written explanation for wangling your data (you can make multiple wrangled data sets). 



## Data Visualization

Include R code and written explanation for your data visualization(s) with at least 3 variables. You must have **at least** one graph. You may have more than one (I would encourage you to have more than one). 

## Conclusion

Answer your research question using the data sets and visualizations you created.
